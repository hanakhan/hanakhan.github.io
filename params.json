I'm always eager to learn new skills and hone existing ones through projects that address real-world problems. \r\n \r\nI’ve always had an interest in solving puzzles. Growing up, my favorite pastimes were reading murder mystery novels and deciphering brain teasers. I enjoy finding answers to problems but I also relish the problem-solving process, which refines my skills, builds my knowledge and helps me grow both personally and professionally.\r\n \r\nCheck out some of my completed and on-going projects below.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Data Analysis, Visualization and Machine Learning\r\nTo view a sample of my work with python and R check out my github repositories @hanakhan\r\n \r\n![Iris Pairplot](https://s22.postimg.org/4lilor1nl/iris_pairplot.png)\r\n[![Iris KMeans Clustering](https://s16.postimg.org/qpl8j7k6d/iris_kmeans.png)](https://postimg.org/image/u97690mw1/)\r\n[![Titanic Correlations Heat Map](https://s16.postimg.org/ifz4cdrvp/titanic_corrmap.png)](https://postimg.org/image/uulwcpjdt/)\r\n \r\n### Conference Posters\r\nVisualizations and analysis for these projects were carried out using NCL. \r\n[![2016_AAGPoster_HK_rev2.png](https://s15.postimg.org/rqfljyecr/2016_AAGPoster_HK_rev2.png)](https://postimg.org/image/lcqigp9gn/)\r\n\r\n[![KhanRaphael_AGUPoster_2015.png](https://s12.postimg.org/5fadeo2m5/Khan_Raphael_AGUPoster_2015.png)](https://postimg.org/image/vnli41mpl/)\r\n \r\n### GIS/Remote Sensing Projects\r\n##Geospatial Analysis using GIS and ENVI\r\nGoal: visualize data of gray fox captures in the SF Bay Area marshes from 1999-2013 and identify which ponds are threatened by future sea level rise\r\nUsed QGIS and ENVI Classic to calculate the NDVI and change detection on Landsat satellite imagery to identify changes in vegetation in the marsh regions \r\nShared my findings with the Don Edwards National Refuge to identify ponds to prioritize for restoration and protection\r\n\r\n[![FoxCaptures_fast.gif](https://s16.postimg.org/rx8rz2lw5/Fox_Captures_fast.gif)](https://postimg.org/image/egbtg7bkh/)\r\n \r\n[![SLR_loop.gif](https://s14.postimg.org/he0qutas1/SLR_loop.gif)](https://postimg.org/image/yejn3hnt9/)\r\n \r\n##Vegetation Change Detection\r\nGoal: to test the hypothesis that mangroves in Bangladesh have been declining\r\nProcessed and manipulated Landsat satellite imagery on ENVI 5.0 using remote sensing algorithms, such as NDVI and change detection\r\nProduced 3D surface view using infrared imagery and topography\r\nDetailed my research process and findings on a [blog](https://savethesundarbans.wordpress.com/)",
