I'm always eager to learn new skills and hone existing ones through projects that address real-world problems. \r\n\r\nIâ€™ve always had an interest in solving puzzles. Growing up, my favorite pastimes were reading murder mystery novels and deciphering brain teasers. I enjoy finding answers to problems but I also relish the problem-solving process, which refines my skills, builds my knowledge and helps me grow both personally and professionally.\r\n\r\nCheck out some of my completed and on-going projects below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Data Analysis, Visualization and Machine Learning\r\nTo view a sample of my work with python and R check out my github repositories @hanakhan\r\n\r\n![Iris Pairplot](https://s22.postimg.org/4lilor1nl/iris_pairplot.png)\r\n[![Iris KMeans Clustering](https://s16.postimg.org/qpl8j7k6d/iris_kmeans.png)](https://postimg.org/image/u97690mw1/)\r\n[![Titanic Correlations Heat Map](https://s16.postimg.org/ifz4cdrvp/titanic_corrmap.png)](https://postimg.org/image/uulwcpjdt/)\r\n\r\n### Conference Posters\r\nVisualizations and analysis for these projects were carried out using NCL. \r\n\r\n### GIS/Remote Sensing Projects\r\n[![FoxNewCaptures.gif](https://s14.postimg.org/ugsz6sbsx/Fox_New_Captures.gif)](https://postimg.org/image/kw9cjwmgt/)\r\n",
